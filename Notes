** conda install env**

# For Windows users# Note: <> denotes changes to be made

#Create a conda environment
conda create --name <environment-name> python=<version:2.7/3.5>

#To create a requirements.txt file:
conda list #Gives you list of packages used for the environment

conda list -e > requirements.txt #Save all the info about packages to your folder

#To export environment file
activate <environment-name>
conda env export > <environment-name>.yml

#For other person to use the environment
conda env create -f <environment-name>.yml

** tip to install env from requirements.txt**

$ while read requirement; do conda install --yes $requirement; done < requirements.txt

Edit: If you would like to install a package using pip if it is not available through conda, give this a go:

$ while read requirement; do conda install --yes $requirement || pip install $requirement; done < requirements.txt

Edit: If you are using Windows (credit goes to @Clay):

$ FOR /F "delims=~" %f in (requirements.txt) DO conda install --yes "%f" || pip install "%f"
